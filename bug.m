In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the use of retain/release cycles.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, or if `MyClass` instances are created without proper management, `myString` will continuously accumulate strong references.  This causes a memory leak, as the allocated `NSString` instances will never be released.  This could go unnoticed for extended periods unless memory profiling tools are used.
